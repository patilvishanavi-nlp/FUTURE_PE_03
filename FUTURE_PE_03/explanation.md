# Task 3 – Explanation

## Objective
The objective of this task is to demonstrate how prompt engineering can be used to build an SEO-focused content system for a business website. Instead of creating isolated blog posts, the task focuses on generating a structured content cluster consisting of a pillar blog and multiple supporting blogs.

## Business Context
The content is designed for a coaching institute based in Pune, targeting students preparing for competitive and board-level examinations. The goal is to improve search visibility, build trust, and attract potential leads through helpful, keyword-optimized content.

## Prompt Strategy
Structured prompts were designed to:
- Generate SEO-optimized blog outlines using H1–H3 headings
- Target high-intent local keywords (service + location)
- Create supporting blogs that strengthen topical authority
- Suggest internal linking between related content

## Outcome
The final output is a complete SEO content pack including one pillar blog and three supporting blogs. The content is suitable for real-world deployment on a business website and follows professional SEO and content marketing practices.
